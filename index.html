        <h5 class="poem-text">
          <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>And sorry I could not travel both<br>And be one traveler, long I stood<br>And looked down one as far as I could<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth.</p>
          <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>Though as for that the passing there<br>Had worn them really about the same.</p>
          <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
          <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference.</p>
